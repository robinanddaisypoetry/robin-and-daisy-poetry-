About

      

Robin and Daisy Poetry is a home for poems written through seasons of darkness and light.

These works trace a path from winter snaps of the soul to thaw, play, forgiveness, and return.


They are written for those who walk quietly, feel deeply, and still choose love.





  

  

    

      
Snowflakes

      

I love all you snowflakes
Each one of you so unique
All shining light in your own way

Some hang in the streetlight
Never to touch the earth
Some land in the river
To become the ocean


Some land on a mountain top
Lasting millions of years
Holding up the sky


My favourite one
Is the one I saw melt in my hand
Forever in my memory

I scatter my poems in the air
Free to land where they may


To fill a sail
To guide a rudder


To land into an outstretched hand
To stand as a shield
To wear as armor


To catch a tear
On your way home
